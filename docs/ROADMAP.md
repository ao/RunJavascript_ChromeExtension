## Implementation Timeline ðŸ“…

### Estimated Development Time
- **Phase 1: Core Enhancements** - 3-4 months
- **Phase 2: Functional Expansion** - 4-5 months  
- **Phase 3: Advanced Features** - 5-6 months
- **Phase 4: Community and Ecosystem** - 6-9 months

**Total Estimated Time:** 18-24 months with a team of 3-5 developers

## Implementation Strategy ðŸŽ¯

1. **Incremental Development**: Implement features in phases, focusing on high-impact, low-complexity features first
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing user scripts continue to function with each update
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback after each phase to validate priorities and adjust subsequent phases
4. **Modular Architecture**: Leverage the extension's modular design for incremental feature additions
5. **Testing First**: Comprehensive testing strategy for each feature before release
